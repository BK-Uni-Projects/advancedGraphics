* The assignment aims to assess practical capability in writing Advanced Graphics programs
* The specific assignment and its requirements are detailed below.
* The CRG is in the <<assignment_01_CRG.asciidoc#, CRG>> document.

== Graphics Features - summary

* The assignment will use the modern programmable graphics pipeline (i.e. OpenGL 3.1+)
  ** Some features may need higher versions of OpenGL

* The assignment is a technical showcase, rather than a (complete) game

* Your program should be useable with mouse and keyboard on a PC

== Submission

* Submit to Blackboard
  ** a PDF of your document
  ** your supporting zip file, including the video, as specified in the following

== PDF Documentation

* Submit to Blackboard
  ** summary document of features implemented, with screenshots of each
  ** reflection on the development process
  ** at least four screenshots of your game running on PC

== Supporting content for your submission (required)

* Submit to Blackboard, a single *.zip* file containing:
  ** all your C++ source code
  ** all your shader source code (if not in your C++ source)
  ** files sufficient to create a working build environment (e.g. conan.io files, cmake files)
  ** all your assets (models, textures)
  ** a compiled, running executable (for PC) (it doesn't need to be able to run outside the IDE)
  ** a video of your program in action (for PC) (at least 30 seconds long; at 1920x1080)
    *** use https://obsproject.com/[OBS], http://www.fraps.com/[fraps], or other tools of your choice
    *** the video should show all the features implemented

== Languages / Toolkit (what you can use)

* You *MUST* use C/C++
* You *MUST* makes the calls into OpenGL yourself
* You *MUST* use appropriate support libraries:
  ** SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf
  ** GLEW
  ** GLM
  ** ASSIMP
  ** Check with {author} ({email}) for any others
* You **CANNOT** use **ANY** tutorial code from the web, even if you cite it - you must write the code
* You **CANNOT** use an existing object-oriented wrapper (e.g. oglplus)
  ** but you can write and use your own if you like ...
* You **CANNOT** use a graphics engine (e.g. Ogre3D, Irrlicht, Three.js)
* You **CANNOT** use a games engine (e.g. Unity)
* If in doubt - **ASK**

== Demo

* The assignment will be assessed through the submitted work, but we'll also do an **in-class demonstration** to the group
* This will take place in the **first workshop session following the submission deadline**
* Demo-ing your work is *standard industry practice*

== Feedback

* you will receive written feedback on Blackboard, as well as verbal feedback during development of your program and in later workshops

== Video

* Your video will also be valuable to yourself as portfolio work
* It will also be valuable to the School
  ** to illustrate to students in following years what they'll be doing in the module
  ** to enhance recruitment and visibility of the School
  ** to support external examiners in seeing what your assignment looked like, without having to run code
