|===
| Criterion | Weight | Pass (50%) | Merit (60%) | Distinction (70%) | Distinction+ (80%+)


| Document
| 10%
| Document includes a list of features and screenshots of each
| As for Pass, plus Document includes control keys for the demo
| As for Merit, plus Document reflects on the development
| As Distinction, plus the reflection is clear, concise and insightful

| Logging and performance
| 10%
| The game logs basic performance information to console, or screen (e.g. render time)
| As for Pass, plus logging breaks down the render and gives details such as batch count
| As for Merit, plus logging is show in the window as renderered text
| As Distinction, plus the log scrolls and uses colours to represent different log events

| Model loading
| 10%
| At least one model is loaded from a file
| Multiple models are loaded from a file, with textures
| Multiple models are loaded from a file, with textures, from at least 2 different formats
| As Distinction, plus a model can be specified (and loaded) with a command line parameter

| Animation
| 10%
| Skeletal Animation on one model, with at least 2 level of hierarchy (body + arms)
| As for Pass, plus more than 2 levels of hierarchy (body + upper arms + lower arms)
| As for Merit, plus Skeletal Animation on multiple models (with different animations)
| As for Distinction, plus at least 10 "instanced" models

| Particle effects
| 10%
| There is a particle effect with at least 1,000 particles, affected by gravity
| As for Pass, plus at least 10,000 particles
| As for Merit, plus particles bounce of some plane/surface/ground
| As for Distinction, plus particles are "bill-boarded"

| Shadows
| 20%
| Some models have "cheat shadows" on the ground beneath them (not connected to the model geometry, e.g. circles)
| As for Pass, plus a "shadow map" is generated and can be shown on-screen on a keypress
| As for Merit, plus some models have shadows that match the geometry
| As for Distinction, plus shadows have good visual qualities (e.g. no/low shadow acne; low aliasing; soft edges )

| Tesselation Shader
| 20%
| There is a tesselated 2D object in the scene (e.g. a triangle made from many smaller (visually evident) triangles)
| As for Merit, plus the tesselation detail of the 3D object can be controlled with keyboard input
| As for Pass, plus there is a tesselated 3D object in the scene (e.g. a sphere)
| As for Distinction, plus the tesselation generates at least 1,000,000 polygons (you'll need to calculate and log the polycount)
