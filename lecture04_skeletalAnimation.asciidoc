== What is Skeletal Animation?

* ???

=== What is Skeletal Animation? 2

* Giving the visual impression of an articulated object
  ** that the surface move under the control of "bones"
* AKA:
  ** rigging / skinning

== Skeletal Animation - example

== Compared to moving whole entities around

* We've already been moving whole entities around
  ** in our vertex shaders
  ** applying the same transformation to *all* vertices in an mesh/entity
* We still need to be able to do this
  ** to locate and oriented our entities in the scen
* For skeletal animation, we want to *also*, and *first* transform individual (or collections of) vertices with the mesh differently

== Bones

* With skeletal animation, we transform (collections of) vertices associated with a "bone", or "bones"
* Usually bones are arranged in a hierarchy, but they don't *have* to be

== What information to we need?

* ???

=== What information to we need?

* Mesh
* A hierarchy of bones
* A set of weightings between bones and vertices
* Information about how to move bones over time

=== Mesh

* collection of vertices
* collection of faces (triangles) connecting those vertices
* in a default / static pose

=== A hierarchy of bones

* Bones are usually in a hierarchy
  ** just like a skeleton
  ** there isn't a consistent/standard *root* of the hierarchy, some options include:
    *** back (if no articulated spine)
    *** some part of the spine

=== A hierarchy of Bones 2

* each bone has a *translation* and *rotation* relative to its parent
  ** bones only rotate
  ** but rotate around a fixed point, represented by the offset
* usually combined into a `mat4`

=== A set of weightings between bones and vertices

* each vertex *can* be influenced by more than one bone
* which bones influence which vertex
  ** perhaps all bones
* how much each vertex is influenced by each bones transformation
  ** AKA blend factor

=== Information about how to move bones over time

* Often a sequence to move the bones through
  ** from Motion Capture, or an animator
  ** usually loaded from a model or animation file
  ** could be calculated dynamically, or hard-coded for testing/development/debugging
* to cause the animation


== Calculating the skeletal transformation

* The final position of each vertex (before transformation of the whole entity) is calculated from by summing the results of:
  ** each bone-transformation multiplied by the weighting for that bone for the present vertex
* We can (*should*/*must*) do this on the GPU
  ** in the vertex shader

== Calculating the bone-transformations

* For each bone we're interested in applying its rotation to vertices
  ** to create transformed vertices
  ** but the rotation needs to take place around the *towards-root* end of the bone
