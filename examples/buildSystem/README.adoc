= SDL2 and other libraries

== Prerequisite Software

* *conan* installed (https://conan.io)
* *cmake* installed (https://cmake.org/)
* some compiler/IDE for you system
  ** e.g. Visual Studio 2015

== Prerequisite Files

* `conanfile.txt` in the root of your project
  ** describing (to conan) which libraries your project needs
* `CMakeLists.txt` in the root of your project
  ** describing (to cmake) how to create a Build System
  ** e.g. what we want cmake to put in our Visual Studio Solution

== Usage (Windows)

1. Start a bash shell #gitbash, for example
2. `mkdir build && cd build`
3. `conan install ..` #ask conan to install packages listed in the parent directory (in conanfile.txt)
4. `cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" #ask cmake to create a Visual Studio Solution
5. `cmake --build . --config Release` #ask cmake to build in Release mode
  ** OR load the Visual Studio solutin (.sln) in the build directory, and build from the UI
6. `./bin/conanTest.exe`cd
  ** OR run from Visual Studio (F5). WARNING: you'll likely get a console window that immediately exits

== Usage (Linux)

1. `./setupBuildSystem.sh`
  ** will get libraries, setup cmake, create make files, and run a smoketest build
2. `./build/bin/conanTest`
